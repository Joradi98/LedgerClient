# LedgerClient
Basic ledger client for iOS

Text based accounting is fine and dandy, but sometimes you want to add transactions on the go, preferably with on your iPhone.
That's where LedgerClient comes in.

Please note, that this project is in a very early stage of development and is not designed to suit the needs of all ledger users.
You may want to configure the way transactions are added depending on your budget's structure.

This being said, every contribution is welcome.
